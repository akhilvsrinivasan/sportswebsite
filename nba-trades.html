<p>The NBA is approaching trade season which usually peaks around January-February due to the Feb 8 trade deadline. The season has been full of unexpected turns with new reports emerging of star players becoming available in the trade market. The NBA has learned that no player is safe anymore, teams are willing to do whatever it is to reach their goal. For most teams it’s either starting a rebuild for the future and selling their assets, or trying to contend and buy more assets to help their team make a run for the Larry O’Brien trophy during June.</p>
     <h3 class="team-title">Golden State Warriors</h3>

<h5>Trade 1</h5>

<p><strong>Atlanta Hawks get:</strong> Trayce Jackson-Davis, Jonathan Kuminga, 2026 unprotected 1st-round pick</p>
<p><strong>Golden State Warriors get:</strong> Onyeka Okongwu</p>

<p>
The Warriors get a much-needed shot-blocking center who can also space the floor
alongside Stephen Curry. Okongwu shoots around 35% from three and averages over
two stocks per game. The Hawks receive Jonathan Kuminga, a versatile wing who can score and defend
positions 1–4, along with Trayce Jackson-Davis and an unprotected 2026 first-round
pick that could land in the late lottery.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Projected Warriors lineup:</strong> Stephen Curry, Moses Moody, Jimmy Butler,
Draymond Green, Onyeka Okongwu
</p>

<p>
    <strong> Projected Hawks lineup:</strong> Trae Young, Dyson Daniels, Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, TJD/Asa Newell
</p> 
<h5>Trade 2</h5>
<p><strong>Golden State Warriors get:</strong> Herb Jones, Yves Missi, Saddiq Bey</p>
<p><strong>New Orleans Pelicans get:</strong> Jonathan Kuminga, Goga Bitadze, GSW 2026 1st, GSW 2029 Top 8 Protected 1st, Orl 26 2nd</p>
<p><strong>Orlando Magic get:</strong> Buddy Hield</p>

<p>
    Warriors receive a two way wing in Herb Jones who they have been linked to for the past year to become the potential missing piece in their lineup. Receive a similar pure scoring wing in Saddiq Bey who’s relatively cheap and has two years left on his contract. I feel like the most underrated and best piece of this trade for the Warriors is Yves Missi, who’s seen a massive decrease in usage due to the success of rookie Derrick Queen. Missi averaged over 8 rebounds when starting last year and averages 1 block a game. Missi also fills a massive void for the Warriors by being one of the most premier offensive rebounders in the league by averaging 3 offensive rebounds a game.</p>
<p>
Pelicans receive Jonathan Kuminga who is a strong scorer at the wing, who can potentially be a future piece if the Pelicans want to capitalize on the trade value of some of their current wings. They also get 2 FRP which can become two late lottery picks and a second. 
Magic traded for Buddy Hield with their desperate need of shooting and gave up a second string center in Bitzade which can let them focus more on their current frontcourt.

    <h3 class="team-title">San Antonio Spurs</h3>
    <figure class="article-image">
  <img src="images/jjj.jpeg" alt="Jaren Jackson trade to the Spurs">

<h5>Trade 1</h5>
<p><strong>San Antonio Spurs Get:</strong> Jaren Jackson Jr., GG Jackson</p>
<p><strong>Memphis Grizzlies Get:</strong> Carter Bryant, Harrison Barnes, Kelly Olynyk, 2027 1st, 2029 Top 5 Protected 1st</p>
<p>
    Grizzlies start the clean up process with trading Jaren Jackson and GG Jackson for a young first round pick in Carter Bryant who has not seen the floor much for the spurs with their recent success. Bryant has a lot of potential but needs to see some more action to gain the experience and fix his struggles on the offensive end, but will definitely get new opportunities with a revamped Grizzlies team. They also receive two expiring contracts and 2 first round picks to start building their draft capital which will most likely be the most popular strategy for teams entering a rebuild in the next couple years.
</p>

<p>Spurs stay young and build their frontcourt with Victor Wembenyama that can be the best shooting and defensive frontcourt in the league to pair with their backcourt pieces like De’Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle and Dylan Harper. They also take a flyer on GG Jackson who has shown he can become a scoring wing that can come off the bench.
</p> 
<p>Extra Note: Even with the growing salary cap in the league, it’s going to become harder for the Spurs to keep their young talent, so the Spurs can’t trade for a guy who’s going to need a new contract or a superstar demanding high money and Jackson’s 35M’s feels like the ceiling of their possible incoming expenses.

<h3 class="team-title">Los Angeles Lakers</h3>

<h5>Trade 1</h5>
<p><strong>Los Angeles Lakers Get:</strong> Herb Jones</p>
<p><strong>New Orleans Pelicans Get:</strong>  Maxi Kleber, Dalton Knecht, 26 Top protected 1st
</p>
<p>Nothing too surprising in this trade, but Lakers try to find their missing piece in Herb Jones and Pelicans get Knecht who’s a young prospect who can shoot the ball along with a 1st round pick that will most likely be in the early 20’s or from 15-20 that will most likely convey.
</p>

<h3 class="team-title">Minnesota Timberwolves</h3>
<figure class="article-image">

<h5>Trade 1</h5>
<p><strong>Minnesota Timberwolves Get:</strong> Dennis Schroder</p>
<p><strong> Sacremento Kings Get:</strong> Mike Conley, Rob Dillingham
</p>
<p>Kings are in a lost spot as a franchise and trade for Rob Dillingham as a potential young piece that can get minutes over the next couple years through whatever they are doing, and might become the primary scorer when on the court.
</p>
<p>
The Timberwolves are looking for a solid point guard to play alongside Anthony Edwards the next couple years and try to help the team win a championship. Schroder can become a piece that will score around 15 points a game, while becoming the point guard the team needs and setting up the offense.
</p>

<h3 class="team-title">Memphis Grizzlies</h3>
<figure class="article-image">
  <img src="images/ja.jpeg" alt="Ja Morant trade to the Magic">
  <figcaption>

<h5>Trade 1</h5>
<p><strong>Memphis Grizzlies Get:</strong> Jalen Suggs, Tristan da Silva, Jase Richardson, 1st Round Pick, 2 2nd round picks</p>
<p><strong>Orlando Magic Get:</strong> Ja Morant, GG Jackson</p>
<p>The Grizzlies have been dealing with drama on and off the court the past couple of years, and after firing their head coach, find themselves below .500 with their star players unhappy. At this point, the whole league is aware that Ja Morant is not safe in Memphis, and a team like the Magic would definitely be calling the Grizzlies phone. They would have to give up Jalen Suggs, who’s an extremely promising guard for the Magic along with Tristian da Silva who hasn’t taken the leap the Magic expected him to take after showing signs of being a great shooter last year. Even with the acquisition of Desmond Bane who’s been thriving on the Magic this season, we know he would be a good fit with Ja. The Grizzlies would receive three extremely promising young players and two 2nd round picks, which would turn their boat in the right direction.</p>

<h3 class="team-title">Houston Rockets</h3>
<figure class="article-image">
  <img src="images/ty.jpeg" alt="Ty Jerome trade to the Rockets">

<h5>Trade 1</h5>
<p><strong>Houston Rockets Get:</strong> Ty Jerome</p>
<p><strong>Memphis Grizzlies Get:</strong> Tari Eason, Jae’Sean Tate, Protected 1st</p>
<p>After the recent success of Memphis's young guards, they have 4 young potential candidates to be their backup point guard or a piece they want to keep a part of their possible rebuild. Trading Ty Jerome and getting a player like Tari Eason that fits their current culture or can be a young player to take a flyer on if they want to rebuild. They also receive a future mid-late first round pick that will most likely convey.

Rockets get a slightly more experienced option than Reed Sheppard at guard to help run their offense this year. Jerome is also on contract for 3 more years at a good price, who they can potentially keep to play the backup guard position next year alongside Sheppard after Fred Vanvleet returns from injury.

<h3 class="team-title">Denver Nuggets</h3>
<figure class="article-image">

<h5>Trade 1</h5>
<p><strong>Denver Nuggets Get:</strong> Quentin Grimes, Eric Gordan</p>
<p><strong>76ers Get:</strong> Julian Strawther, Zeke Nnaji, 2nd round pick</p>
<p>The Nuggets focus on trying to win another championship this year and give up some of their young players, for an established scorer in Quentin Grimes. Grimes will add a lot more scoring to the team and would be a good option for David Adelman to come off the bench and help the Nuggets take more pressure off Jokic on the offensive side of the ball. The 76ers, who have shown they do not plan on re-signing Quentin Grimes let him go for two young players and a 2nd round pick.</p>
<h5>Trade 2</h5>
<p><strong>Denver Nuggets Get:</strong> Tre Jones</p>
<p><strong>Chicago Bulls Get:</strong> Julian Strawther, Zeke Nnaji, 2nd round pick</p>
<p>The Nuggets are looking for a guard who can back up Jamal Murray and Tre Jones who has been a great acquisition for the Bulls since he was thrown into the Zach Lavine trade. The Bulls will get back a young piece in Julian Strawther, who showed glimpses of being a reliable 3D player last year for the Nuggets. Strawther has been struggling to stay healthy and has not seen the floor as much as the Nuggets would've expected him to even when healthy this season.
</p>

<h3 class="team-title">Phoenix Suns</h3>
<figure class="article-image">
  <img src="images/zion.jpeg" alt="Zion WIlliamson traded to Suns">

<h5>Trade 1:</h5>
<p><strong>Phoenix Suns Get: </strong>Zion Williamson</p>
<p><strong>New Orleans Pelicans Get: </strong>Jalen Green, Ryan Dunn, 1st Round Pick, 2 Seconds
</p>
<p>The Suns have rebounded from their last dumpster fire of a season in a good way, fighting for a top 6 seed. This is with the absence of Jalen Green, but due to his absence we’ve seen the other guards and wings on the team develop into really solid players. The offense does need help, with its main option being Devin Booker and then the 2nd option being Dillion Brooks. Brooks has been one of the most impressive players this season, but he’s still mainly a defensive player, he’s also extremely unreliable and inefficient when it comes to scoring the ball. Instead of replacing a guy like Brooks or Colin Gilslspe in the starting lineup when Green returns, the Suns should look to find an offensive player to run their four. Despite focusing on improving their centers this offseason, the offense has lacked size in their lineups and a player like Zion Williamson could really thrive under their system and help this team reach its full potential.
